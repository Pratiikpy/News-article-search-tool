Info Hunter
Info Hunter is a tool that helps you quickly find and organize information on any topic you're interested in. It searches a popular news website, Google, and forums for articles, posts, and discussions related to your query, and uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract key phrases from the content. The results are then compiled into a single, easy-to-read CSV file.

With Info Hunter, you can get a broad overview of any topic in just a few clicks, saving you time and effort in your research. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just curious about the world, Info Hunter is the perfect tool for you.

Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher

How to Use
Using Info Hunter is simple. Just follow these steps:

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to save the results.
Run the search function with a query string as the argument. For example:
Copy code
search('data science')
This will search for information on the topic of "data science" and save the results to a CSV file named "data_science_results.csv".

Open the CSV file to view the results. You'll see a list of articles, posts, and discussions, along with their titles, URLs, and key phrases extracted using NLP.

Use the key phrases to get a sense of the main points and themes discussed in the results. You can also click on the URLs to read the full content of each result.

Errors
If there are any errors during the search process, they will be printed to the console. If you encounter an error, try running the search function again. If the error persists, please open an issue or submit a pull request with details of the error.
